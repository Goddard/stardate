#Stardate
##Date to Star Trek TNG star date converter

This package is meant to convert an existing date to a stardate similar to Star Trek : The Next Generation.  It is feature complete in that regard.  I would like to add more options and different packages to this eventually.  If you want to work on something feel free to make a pull request and submit your own changes.

###Roadmap
	- 1. Add additional timelines
	- 2. Create additional plugins for various other sources(gnome shell, kde, pelican, wordpress)

###License
This project I made is open source.  Feel free to use it and make changes.

###Credit
